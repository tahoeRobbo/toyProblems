//I suspect the online poker game I'm playing shuffles cards by doing a single " riffle â†´ ."
//
//To prove this, let's write a function to tell us if a full deck of cards shuffled_deck is a single riffle of two other halves half1 and half2.
//
//We'll represent a stack of cards as an array of integers in the range 1..521..52 (since there are 5252 distinct cards in a deck).
//
//Why do I care? A single riffle is not a completely random shuffle. If I'm right, I can make more informed bets and get rich and finally prove to my ex that I am not a "loser with an unhealthy cake obsession" (even though it's too late now because she let me go and she's never getting me back).


var singleRiffleChecker = function(shuffledDeck, half1, half2) {
	
	//loop through the shuffledDeck and split it every other card.
	for(var i =0; i < shuffledDeck.length; i++) {
			if(shuffledDeck[i] % 2 === 0){
				half1.push(shuffledDeck[i]);
			}
			half2.push(shuffledDeck[i]);
		}
	
	console.log(half2, ' half2', half1, ' half1');
