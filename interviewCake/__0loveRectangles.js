//A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
//They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.
//
//It must
//be love
//Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
//
//As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
//
//They are defined as hashes â†´ like this:
//
//  my_rectangle = {
//
//    # coordinates of bottom-left corner:
//    'x' => 1,
//    'y' => 5,
//
//    # width and height
//    'width' => 10,
//    'height' => 4,
//
//}
//
//Your output rectangle should use this format as well.

function loveOverlap(rec1, rec2){
	//find overlap on x
	
	//find overlap on y
	
	//create a new rectangle to return with x, y, width, and height params
		//width and height will be x and y overlaps
		//bottom left corner will be rec2.x
}
